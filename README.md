The most popular tool to localize and manage all kind of applications with resx-based resources, 
with more than 300K downloads from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomEnglert.ResXManager) 
and hundreds of [5 star reviews](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomEnglert.ResXManager#review-details)

This tool provides central access to all ResX-based string resources in your solution. You can quickly navigate through all resource files and view the content in a well-arranged data grid.
All available languages are displayed side by side in columns, to make it easy to find untranslated strings or clean up orphaned entries. All strings can be quickly edited in place, untranslated entries will be created on the fly while typing.

Suitable for any .Net application; WPF is supported if you use the x:Static markup extension to access the ResX - resources.

Available as VS2012-2017 extension and as standalone executable to support VS2010 and older or users without Visual Studio at all.
A scipting module is available as well, so you can easily automate resource tasks, e.g. export untranslated string during build.

All versions can be downladed from the [releases](../../releases) page.

The Visual Studio Extension is also available at the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomEnglert.ResXManager), or by searching for RESX in the Visual Studio extension manager.
