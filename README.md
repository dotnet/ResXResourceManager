This is a community driven Open Source project. 
As such it needs your support to keep it alive and evolving. 
The best way to contribute is to help [fixing bugs, or adding new features](https://github.com/tom-englert/ResXResourceManager/issues).
However, if you cannot help with coding, consider to [donate a small amount](Documentation/Topics/Donate.md) to ensure <span>ResX&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;Manager</span> will continue to be a great project that can help you in your daily work.

This tool provides central access to all ResX-based string resources in your solution. You can quickly navigate through all resource files and view the content in a well-arranged data grid.
All available languages are displayed side by side in columns, to make it easy to find untranslated strings or clean up orphaned entries. All strings can be quickly edited in place, untranslated entries will be created on the fly while typing.

Suitable for any .Net application; WPF is supported out of the box, just use the x:Static markup extension to access the ResX - resources.

Web applications using Typescript (e.g. Angular) are also supported, see [L10N-Web-Demo](https://github.com/tom-englert/L10N-Web-Demo)

Xamarin apps can be supported using e.g. [XamarinLocalizationSync](https://github.com/maruhe/XamarinLocalizationSync)
